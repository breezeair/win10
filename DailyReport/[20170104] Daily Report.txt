1.     Tasks:

·       Apply the knowledge points about UI in my App.
·       Try to understand how to write motions.

 
2.     Learning Points:

·      the usage of XAML common controls
·      how to design and apply styles to controls
·      make clear the meaning of Navigation, Command elements and Content elements, so as to Layout 
·      the usage of templates and resources


3.     Questions:

·      I write a style for button as samples. But it doesn't work and report errors. I'm looking for the root cause.
·      What the NavigationCacheMode affects.

 
4.     Arrangement next day

·      Learning the knowledge of style, controls, patterns, inputs and usability.

 
5.     Problems summary, how to improve

·      Up to now, I am nearly clear about the construction of styles and can modify most of them on demand. But I can not write styles all by myself.
·      I have browsed the knowledge points about layout, style, controls and patterns in MSDN. But less than half of the extensive or detailed points provided through links alternate with articles. I only remember part of them.
·      Part of the knowledge points about UI Which I have viewed have not been applied in my code practicing. 
·      All these problems need persistent efforts.
·      Now I'm also blind to the animation and motion. I need to get tips from the samples and blend and ask for help.
