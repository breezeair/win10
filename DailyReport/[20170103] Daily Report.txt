5.     Problems summary, how to improve

       There is a lot of knowledge to learn, I should not  spend too much time on code practicing of some knowledge points. 

       It may take much time to modify the codes to adjust the UI.  Avoid not to be too immersed in a knowledge point.  Find help from the official sample code if possible.

       Previously learned knowledge points need to be reviewed from time to time and applied in code for depth understanding.
